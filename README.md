# temp-controlled-fan

## Overview
This circuit uses lm393 to compare voltages between the threshold and the tmp36. If the tmp36 exceeds the threshold temperature set by the user, a signal is sent to the nmosfet to activate and LED is turned on indicate the dc motor is moving. The lm393 activates a buzzer when tmp36 temperature exceeds its maximum temperature.
