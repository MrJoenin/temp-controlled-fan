# temp-controlled-fan

## Overview
This circuit uses the LM393 comparator to compare the voltage from a TMP36 temperature sensor with a user-defined threshold. When the temperature measured by the TMP36 exceeds the set threshold, a signal is sent to the NMOSFET, activating it, which in turn turns on an LED to indicate that the DC motor is running. Additionally, the LM393 will activate a buzzer if the TMP36 detects a temperature that exceeds its maximum limit.
